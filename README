GridEditWidget
==============

jqGrid widget for Apotomo.

You can see by its structure probably that I am working toward making it a proper plugin, maybe even a gem.
At the moment, though it's kind of halfway there, I doubt it will install properly as a plugin.

My rdoc-ization is although kind of weak, but I expect it will be improved.  You're looking at this at a pretty
early stage in the development.

No tests yet either.  I know.


Example
=======

Example goes here.  Eventually.

In the meantime, there is an example Rails 3 app that incorporates this widget to show what it can
do and I how I expected it to be used.
